    "The exec tool runs a simple command (e.g. echo hello) and returns stdout, stderr, and exitCode",
    "The tool times out after the configured duration (default 5 minutes) and returns an error",
    "Standard error output is captured in the stderr field, not mixed into stdout",
    "Background execution mode (when supported) returns immediately with a process handle",
    "The tool result is truncated at configured max length (default 20KB) if output is excessive"
